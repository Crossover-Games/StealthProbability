  - "The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively
    gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30
    seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster
    each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed
    every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run
    as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound,
    your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!\u2026
    Start."
